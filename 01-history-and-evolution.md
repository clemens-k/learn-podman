# Podman Foundation and History

## Introduction

This document covers the foundation and history of Podman, exploring its origins at Red Hat, evolution through major releases, key contributors, and its position within the broader container ecosystem.

## Origins of Podman at Red Hat

### Background and Motivation

Podman emerged from Red Hat's need to address fundamental security and architectural concerns with existing container tools, particularly Docker. The project was born out of the recognition that the Docker daemon model presented several challenges:

- **Single Point of Failure**: The Docker daemon represented a central point of failure that could affect all containers on a system
- **Root Privilege Requirements**: All Docker operations required root-level access, creating security concerns
- **Process Ownership**: The daemon owned all child container processes, leading to potential orphaned processes on failure
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: The building of containers could introduce security risks due to the privileged nature of the daemon

### Key Founding Principles

From its inception, Podman was designed around several core principles:

1. **Daemonless Architecture**: Eliminate the need for a central daemon process by having Podman directly interact with the kernel
2. **Rootless Containers**: Enable non-privileged users to run containers without requiring root access
3. **OCI Compliance**: Full adherence to Open Container Initiative standards for container images and runtimes
4. **Drop-in Compatibility**: Provide command-line compatibility with Docker to ease migration
5. **Security by Design**: Implement security as a fundamental architectural principle rather than an add-on

### Initial Development Team

Podman was initially developed as part of the libpod project at Red Hat, with key founding contributors including:

- **Dan Walsh** (@rhatdan): Principal architect and security expert who drove the vision for rootless containers and security-focused design
- **Matt Heon** (@mheon): Core developer and maintainer who implemented much of the initial architecture
- **Daniel J Walsh**: Security consultant who championed the user namespace approach and rootless container technology

The project benefited from Red Hat's extensive experience with container technologies through their work on:

- CRI-O (Container Runtime Interface for Kubernetes)
- Buildah (container image building tool)
- Skopeo (container image management tool)
