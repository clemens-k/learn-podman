## Additional Recommendations

### Project Structure Enhancements

1. **Create a `examples/` directory** - Include practical examples, Containerfiles, and
   configuration samples
2. **Add a `scripts/` directory** - Store utility scripts for common tasks and demonstrations
3. **Include a `glossary.md`** - Define technical terms and acronyms for quick reference
4. **Create `troubleshooting.md`** - Document common issues and solutions encountered during learning

### Learning Enhancement Strategies

1. **Hands-on Labs** - Create practical exercises for each work package
2. **Version Control Integration** - Use Git branches for different learning phases
3. **Progress Tracking** - Maintain a learning log with timestamps and insights
4. **Community Engagement** - Join Podman community forums and contribute questions/answers

### Technical Setup Recommendations

1. **Multi-environment Testing** - Test on different Linux distributions
2. **Integration Testing** - Set up CI/CD pipeline examples
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Include monitoring and observability examples
4. **Security Scanning** - Integrate container security scanning tools

### Documentation Quality Standards

1. **Code Examples** - Include working, tested examples in all documentation
2. **Visual Aids** - Add diagrams for complex concepts (architecture, workflows)
3. **Cross-references** - Link related concepts across documents
4. **Regular Updates** - Plan for periodic review and updates as Podman evolves

## Estimated Timeline

- **Total Duration:** 20-28 hours of focused learning
- **Suggested Schedule:** 2-3 work packages per week over 3-4 weeks
- **Flexibility:** Work packages can be completed independently after WP1

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All work packages completed with comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Practical examples tested and verified
- [ ] Migration strategy validated with a real application
- [ ] Autostart configuration successfully implemented
- [ ] Resource collection provides ongoing learning path

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan and make any desired adjustments
2. Set up the project structure with directories and initial files
3. Begin with WP1: Foundation and History
4. Establish a regular learning schedule
5. Consider sharing progress with the Podman community for feedback
