Okay, I would like to learn more about podman and I want to document my
learning journey in this repo.

The things I am particular interested in are:

- the history and evolution of podman
- comparison with other virutalization techniques
- the role it plays in Red Hats In-Vehicle Operating System
- migration from "native" deployments to podman container
- all I need to know about OCI containers
- useful online resources
- commonly used podman commands
- how to autostart containers at system startup

I prefer markdown files for documentation (because on github I can
directly view them).

Before you start working on those topics, please create a plan (in a markdown
file) with work packages. I want to manually review it and possibly make
adjustments, before you start working on those work packages.

Do you have any other recommendation for me for this project?

---

Okay, you learning plan markdown file is not linted properly. How can we make
sure all files in this repo uphold a certain quality standard?

---

Nice. Before we proceed: there is one more topic I interested in: how does the
tecstack of podman look like. Or in other words: what are the dependencies
(hardware and software) of podman. For hardware prerequisites: I am interested
in ARM and Intel architecture.

---

Please add a .gitignore file.

---

Please create a commit and a short (5 lines max) commit message

---

Please start with work package 1: Foundation and History

---
Before we create a PR, I would like to separate "work package description and
implementation tracking" (LEARNING_PLAN.md) and the "User documentation" (README.md).

Please remove any hints in the README.md of what is about to come, but limit
yourself to what this repo currently offers in terms of learning path.

Update the Learning_Plan.md with the current implementation status. But keep
it short, don't add additional chapter, but just mark the WP1 as completed.
